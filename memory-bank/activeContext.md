# Active Context

## Current Focus
Building a Google Drive clone with emphasis on:
1. Clean, modular architecture
2. Secure file handling
3. Efficient database design
4. Responsive user interface

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Next.js App Router**
   - Leveraging server components for improved performance
   - Built-in API routes for backend functionality
   - Simplified deployment process

2. **Authentication with Clerk**
   - Robust auth system out of the box
   - Built-in user management
   - Easy integration with Next.js

3. **Database Choice (PostgreSQL + Prisma)**
   - Strong data consistency
   - Excellent TypeScript support
   - Powerful querying capabilities
   - Type-safe database operations

4. **File Storage (AWS S3)**
   - Reliable and scalable
   - Cost-effective for storage
   - Strong security features
   - Good developer experience

### Implementation Patterns
1. **File Upload Strategy**
   - Direct-to-S3 upload using presigned URLs
   - Progress tracking with client-side hooks
   - Metadata stored in PostgreSQL

2. **Folder Structure**
   - Recursive folder relationships
   - Efficient querying patterns
   - Cascade deletions for cleanup

3. **UI Components**
   - ShadCN UI for consistent design
   - Custom hooks for file operations
   - Responsive layout system

## Current Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement pagination for large folders
- Use virtual scrolling for file lists
- Optimize image previews
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Security Measures
- Validate file types on upload
- Implement file size limits
- Secure route protection
- Regular security audits

### User Experience
- Clear loading states
- Error handling
- Progress indicators
- Intuitive navigation

## Project Insights

### Key Patterns to Maintain
1. **Type Safety**
   - Strict TypeScript usage
   - Zod validation
   - Prisma generated types

2. **Performance**
   - Server components where possible
   - Optimistic updates
   - Efficient data fetching
   
3. **Security**
   - Input validation
   - Route protection
   - Secure file handling

### Potential Challenges
1. **File Upload**
   - Large file handling
   - Upload progress tracking
   - Error recovery

2. **Performance**
   - Large folder navigation
   - File preview loading
   - Database query optimization

3. **UX Considerations**
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Loading states
   - Error feedback
